# CODSOFT-Image-Captioning
Image Captioning with Deep Learning
This repository contains a Python application for generating captions for images using deep learning techniques. 
It combines computer vision and natural language processing to provide descriptive captions for uploaded images.
The code is implemented using the Flask web framework, Keras, and the ResNet-50 model for feature extraction.



This project makes use of the following libraries and models:

Flask: A Python web framework.
Keras: A deep learning library.
ResNet-50: A pre-trained deep learning model for feature extraction.
